            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>I am a passionate technologist with a diverse background in various fields.</p>
            <br class="small">
            <p>I started my technology career in 2019, my first startup was an ecommerce platform. I began this with two co-founders I befriended during undergrad.</p>
            <p>I had done contractor work before then, but this was when things became much more serious as it related to a legitimate career.</p>
            <br class="large">
            <p>In 2020, shortly after, I transitioned into hardware development, working on projects that combined software and physical devices.</p>
            <br class="xxsmall">
            <p>One of biggest projects I worked on during this time in terms of significance was a medical device designed for epidemic prevention.</p>
            <p>This was my first invention I could claim as mine entirely — I am the only person listed on the USPTO patent filing.</p>
            <p>This was also the product of the second startup I was involved with, where I was the solo founder.</p>
            <br class="xxsmall">
            <p>In 2023, I ended this operation.</p>
            <p>Since then, I've been looking to license the technology I developed during this time.</p>
            <br class="xlarge">
            <p>After this, I began graduate studies at USC in Integrated Design, Business, and Technology.</p>
            <p>I also took advantage of the university's networks and resources during this time to explore work in research commercialization.</p>
            <p>In 2025, I began advisory work for a brain-computer interface spinout that originated at USC.</p>
            <p>I also taught robotics, hardware prototyping, and programming to young students when I was a graduate student.</p>
            <br class="small">
            <p>Outside of helping scientists become founders themselves, I have also done advisory work for more conventional startups from outside of academia.</p>
            <p>One of these is for an AI-powered R&D tool for molecular discovery relating to exotic polymers.</p>
            <p>I also wrote and published my first book in late 2024, and have written more about technology, business, and futures studies since then.</p>
            <br class="large">
            <p>Currently, I am focused on completing my master's degree while continuing my advisory work.</p>
            <p>I am also exploring new project ideas and potential collaborations in the tech space.</p>

            <h2>My Values</h2>
            <p>I believe in the power of technology to rewrite reality, as well as progress, disruption, and change for the sole sake of transformative growth.</p>
            <br class="large">
            <p>I am committed to continuous learning and growth, both personally and professionally.</p>
            <br class="xxsmall">
            <p>Ultimately, I see myself as the real project.</p>
            <br class="large">
            <p>I value collaboration and teamwork, recognizing that the best ideas often come from diverse perspectives.</p>
            <br class="large">
            <p>I am passionate about sharing knowledge and empowering others to achieve their goals.</p>
            <br class="large">
            <p>I believe strongly in long-term thinking, and have a deep nostalgia for the future.</p>
